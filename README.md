[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/derroylo/shopware-workspace-sample)

## What is this?
This is an example workspace for [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) with the eCommerce System [Shopware](https://www.shopware.com) which aims to provide a fully usable workspace for development instead of just a simple sample.

## Getting started
Use the Button "Open in Gitpod" above to start a new workspace based on this repo. The first start will take some time (around 10 to 15 minutes) as he needs to build the Dockerfile, start the services and install Shopware with some demo data. Afterwards you will see your IDE Instance and the Frontend of the Store should open in your Browser. To access the backend just append `/admin` to the url and login with the user `admin` and the password `shopware`.

## Available services
Some additional services are already added via docker-compose.yml but you can add more any time.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - Database
